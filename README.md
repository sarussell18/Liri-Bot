The challenge in this exercise was to create a command line interface version of Siri that would use twitter, spotify and OMDB. 
liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

    * `my-tweets`

    * `spotify-this-song`

    * `movie-this`

    * `do-what-it-says`
    
    This was a challenging assignment, but older activities, familiarity with API calls and of course google and stack overflow were very helpful 
    in completing this project.
